A smart [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [AniList](https://anilist.co) that understands your anime and manga taste - not just raw API calls.

## What makes this different

Most AniList integrations mirror the API 1:1. ani-mcp adds an intelligence layer on top:

- **Taste profiling** - builds a model of your preferences from your completed list
- **Personalized picks** - "what should I watch next?" based on your taste and mood
- **Compatibility** - compare taste between two users
- **Year in review** - your watching/reading stats wrapped up

Plus the essentials: search, details, trending, seasonal browsing, list management, and community recommendations. All search and browse tools support pagination for browsing beyond the first page of results.

## Install

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `mcp.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json`, Cursor settings, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anilist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ani-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANILIST_USERNAME": "your_username"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Works with any MCP-compatible client.

## Examples

Here are some things you can ask your AI assistant once ani-mcp is connected:

**"What should I watch next?"**
Uses `anilist_pick` to analyze your completed list, build a taste profile, and recommend titles from your Planning list (or discover new ones) ranked by how well they match your preferences.

**"Compare my taste with username123"**
Uses `anilist_compare` to find shared titles, compute a compatibility score, highlight biggest disagreements, and suggest cross-recommendations between the two profiles.

**"What's airing this season?"**
Uses `anilist_seasonal` to show the current season's anime lineup sorted by popularity, with scores, genres, and episode counts.

**"Why would I like Vinland Saga?"**
Uses `anilist_explain` to score a specific title against your taste profile, breaking down genre affinity, theme alignment, and community reception.

**"Show me my anime year in review"**
Uses `anilist_wrapped` to summarize everything you watched in a given year - titles completed, average score, top genres, most controversial pick, and total episodes.

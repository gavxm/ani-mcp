# ani-mcp

A smart [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for [AniList](https://anilist.co) that understands your anime and manga taste - not just raw API calls.

## What makes this different

Most AniList integrations mirror the API 1:1. ani-mcp adds an intelligence layer on top:

- **Taste profiling** - builds a model of your preferences from your completed list
- **Personalized picks** - "what should I watch next?" based on your taste and mood
- **Compatibility** - compare taste between two users
- **Year in review** - your watching/reading stats wrapped up

Plus the essentials: search, details, trending, seasonal browsing, list management, and community recommendations.

## Install

Add to your MCP client config (e.g. `mcp.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json`, Cursor settings, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anilist": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "ani-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANILIST_USERNAME": "your_username"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Works with any MCP-compatible client.
